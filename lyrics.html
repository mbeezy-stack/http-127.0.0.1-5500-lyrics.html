                    Lyrics</h3>
                I can tell you're not a fan, listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz
                Don't try to come around lookin' for love, it's not here (yeah)
                Any time you hit me, I was never not there (yeah)
                I don't wanna fight, I wanna take you to Chanel ('nel)

                Can I tell you somethin'? I just hope you never tell (yeah)
                I said you was a dub, I meant to say you was a ten
                I don't wanna do this shit again, aw, man
                I don't wanna do this shit again, not again

                Listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz
                I don't even get the time to fuck you on the weekends
                Any time you pull up on me, baby, it's a secret
                I don't wanna fight, I wanna fuck you in Chanel
                At least you can never tell me that I'm not real
                How you tellin' everybody, callin' it a secret?
                Yeah, I know they wanna score on me, I'm playin' defense

                Stay away from the fakes (stay away), my nigga, stay away from the jakes
                Heard 'em talkin' 'bout they wanna put my name on the plate
                But I ain't one, I just hope you niggas wear a hoodie when the rain come
                I just hope you niggas don't think you really stainless

                I just hope my niggas don't ever, ever change on me
                Oh, you really think you're so official? I'm the same one
                They been tellin' me I fell off since I came up
                Baby girl, listen, you're way better than a bartender

                Told my niggas, "Just ten toes, stand tall, yeah"
                Know my niggas won't ever, ever let me fall, nigga
                I tried not to fall in love, but we all fell in
                We tried to find nine-to-fives, but we was all felons

                I got rich, and I threw away all of my Margielas
                They was jealous, when I copped a Richard, they got more jealous
                More money, more bitches, I'm feelin' marvelous

                And I did some fucked up shit, but I was starvin' then
                No fussin', just hit 'em up, ain't no arguin'
                No runnin', just spin the block, don't you talk to them
                My old bitches love me, and I don't even fuck with them, look

                I can tell you're not a fan, listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz
                Don't you come around lookin' for love, it's not here
                Any time you hit me, I was never not there
                I don't wanna do this shit again, not again (whoa)

                Listen, baby, this a Lamborghini, not a Benz (yeah)
                I don't even get the time to fuck you on the weekends
                Any time you pull up on me, baby, it's a secret
                I don't wanna fight, I wanna fuck you in Chanel (yeah)
                At least you can never tell me that I'm not real
                How you tellin' everybody, callin' it a secret?
                Yeah, I know they wanna score on me, I'm playin' defense
